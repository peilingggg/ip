# Test UI

Use `test/ui-test-plan.md` as the source of truth. Record the program command and
every test case there before testing. Each test case must contain:

- a unique name and aim;
- the console commands to enter, in an `Inputs` fenced text block; and
- the complete expected console output, in an `Expected output` fenced text block.

Run all recorded cases from the repository root:

```bash
python3 .codex/skills/test-ui/scripts/run_ui_tests.py test/ui-test-plan.md
```

The runner starts a fresh program process for each case, sends the listed inputs
to standard input, and compares standard output exactly after normalizing only
Windows line endings. It prints the input and actual output as a console-session
record. On the first failure, it prints the expected and actual outputs, exits
non-zero, and does not run later cases.

If the plan's program command does not work in the current environment, report
that blocker without claiming that the tests passed. Do not silently alter
expected output to match a failure; change it only when the requirement changes.
